# Visual Dayschedules

This is a web-based tool designed to help individuals — especially children and young people with intellectual
disabilities — gain structure, clarity, and autonomy in their daily routines. Through an intuitive system of icons and
minimal text, the application enables users and their caretakers to create personalized, visually accessible day
schedules.

## Why This Project?

Clear communication is not always a given. For individuals with low literacy or cognitive challenges, conventional
schedules and instructions can be confusing, overwhelming, or entirely inaccessible. This project was born out of a real
need for clarity, calm, and control — first identified during youth camps organized by Kazou, and later expanded in
collaboration with professionals from the orthopedagogical center Sint-Ferdinand.

## Core Features

- 🧩 Modular Schedule Creation – Add day parts, customize time blocks, and assign recognizable icons to activities.
- 🖨️ Printable PDFs – Export your schedule to a clean, A3-sized printable format.
- 🧠 Icon-Driven Design – Built with a consistent, flexible icon system that supports understanding without relying on
  text.
- 🖱️ User-Friendly Interface – Designed for both professionals and volunteers with minimal technical experience.
- 🎯 Accessibility First – Minimal distractions, neutral colors, clean design — clarity is key.

## Philosophy

Sometimes, the clearest communication happens without words. This project strips communication down to its essentials: a
message, clearly sent and effortlessly received. With Woord in Beeld, every user — regardless of reading ability — can
find structure, feel empowered, and participate more independently in daily life.
