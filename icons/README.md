# Icons

This directory contains the custom icon library used throughout the Visual Day Schedules application. Icons are a crucial part of the project, providing visual cues for various activities and concepts.

## Adding New Icons
A template is provided for creating new icons. 

- Each icon should be in an artboard of `64px x 64px`
- When adding a person icon, ensure that the limbs are rotated correctly to match the existing icons in the library. 
- Each part of the body should be aligned 5 degrees. 
- The icon should be centered in the artboard, when the root of the person is not aligned to the pixel grid, align it manually.
